Code in `src/external` has its own licenses as described in the respective
files.

Some code snippets in the `TextureStochastic` and stochastic texture sampling
fragment shader implementation are copy-pasted from the stochastic texture
sampling demo by Thomas Deliot and Eric Heitz which probably has no license.

License of the remaining files: MIT
