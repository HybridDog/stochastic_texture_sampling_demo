# TODO

* The image is upside down
* Add an image which shows "press h" and show help text when pressing h, which
  shows info about all key combinations, mouse, drag and drop, etc.
* Fill the whole window instead of using a fixed resolution
* Improve the user interaction (key combinations, etc.)
* Bundle everything into a single html file
* Add a HTTP option which enables rounding uv coordinates in the shader and
  disables interpolation. This is needed for Minetest textures.
* Code quality and comments; perhaps somebody is going to read my code
* Support high bit depth and wide gamut images
