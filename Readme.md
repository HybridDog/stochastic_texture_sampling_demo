# TODO

* Fill the whole window instead of using a fixed resolution
* Improve the user interaction (key combinations, etc.)
* Bundle everything into a single html file
* Add a HTTP option which enables rounding uv coordinates in the shader and
  disables interpolation. This is needed for Minetest textures.
* Code quality and comments; perhaps somebody is going to read my code
* Support high bit depth and wide gamut images
